        <ul>
          <li>
            Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical
            appearance, body size, race, socioeconomic status, or religion (or lack thereof)
          </li>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="pt-1 pb-4">
      <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Enforcement</h5>
      <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
      <p>
        Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors
        should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes,
        or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all
        participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
      </p>
      <p>Event organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.</p>
      <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!</p>

      <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Reporting</h5>
