# DeLorean Project - GDG DevFest/IWD/Event Website Template

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) and utilizes [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) for Database, Storage, and Hosting to create a fully functional and customizable template for your Google Developer Group's DevFest/IWD/Event.
